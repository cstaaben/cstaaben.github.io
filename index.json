[{"content":"\u003cp\u003eWelcome to my simple little site. The posts I make here will contain code, links\nto code, and thoughts about code and technology. I\u0026rsquo;m not omniscient and I\ncertainly am not an expert in any field, so I\u0026rsquo;ve enabled comments on my posts to\nlet any readers comment on the posts to provide corrections\nor findings of their own. The best environment for working in tech is a\nlearning-friendly environment, I\u0026rsquo;ve found. To that end, I\u0026rsquo;d like to keep\nthe comments on this site troll, spam, and abuse free. I want to foster learning\nand conversation. Please stick to the following guidelines:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBe polite - respect others and follow the \u0026ldquo;Golden Rule\u0026rdquo;. There are people on\nthe other side of the screen, and what is said here can affect them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0026rsquo;t troll - I welcome criticisms of my thoughts, opinions, and code but if\nyour comments are inflammatory, add no value to the ongoing discussion, or are\ninsulting will be deleted without exception.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0026rsquo;t spam - I don\u0026rsquo;t expect this site to generate much traffic, so there\u0026rsquo;s not\nreally much point to spam my posts. Any comments deemed to be spam will be\ndeleted without exception.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo summarize: don\u0026rsquo;t be a jerk. This is a personal site, and is unaffiliated with\nany organization, company, or group. I really don\u0026rsquo;t want to\nremove comments from my posts, but I am willing to go that far. Don\u0026rsquo;t ruin it\nfor others who might actually want to participate in a discussion.\u003c/p\u003e\n","description":null,"image":null,"permalink":"https://cstaaben.github.io/blogs/comment_policy/","title":"Comment policy"},{"content":"\u003ch2 id=\"the-beginning\"\u003eThe beginning\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is the begining of what I\u0026rsquo;m striving to continue running for quite some time.\nMy initial reason for starting this was to hopefully get more interest from\npotential employers. After thinking about it some, I want to make it something\nmore. I want this to be a place for discussion about programming, game\ndevelopment, tech news, whatever. A learning environment. The world is full of\nnegativity, and if I can foster one little area of positivity, I will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also want to push myself. I was diagnosed with ADHD last year and I want to\npush myself to put coherent thoughts down and put them out where people can read\nand criticize them. I want to improve my technical writing skills (or maybe just\nlearn some of those). I want to write tutorials to help people learn, even if\nthere are hundreds of the same thing already out there. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll explain\nsomething slightly differently than someone else and it\u0026rsquo;ll click for someone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith that, here\u0026rsquo;s a brief introduction:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy name is Corbin Staaben and, as of this writing, I am 30 years old. I enjoy\nreading, coding, and playing video games. I spend way too much money supporting\nnew and exciting tabletop RPGs and services for those games that I never really\nget to play. I work as a software engineer. I\u0026rsquo;ve been married for 10 years and\nhave two wonderfully rambunctious daughters. My ADHD has caused me to pick up\nand drop a plethora of hobbies and activities, and I\u0026rsquo;m hoping to make\nmaintaining this site and writing posts here stick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-plan\"\u003eThe plan\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think my first thing to pursue is writing my own rogue-like. I\u0026rsquo;ve seen a\ncouple, and worked on a couple of similar projects, but I\u0026rsquo;ve never dived into\nthe deep end of procedurally generated content and taken a good, hard look at\ngame development. Initially, I think I\u0026rsquo;ll just follow a tutorial, probably for\nPython since I\u0026rsquo;m pretty familiar with that, and write it in Go. Each post will\ncontain things I learned, things I struggled with, and the end result of the\nprogress I made. Who knows, maybe by the end of it I\u0026rsquo;ll have an idea of what to\nwrite for my own tutorial series.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would also like to pursue learning some GoDot (I think that\u0026rsquo;s what it\u0026rsquo;s\ncalled). A couple of work friends have published a game or two using it, and it\nsounds intriguing. I have had a project one of my college professors gave us\nstuck in my head for quite some time as a learning exercise in Python and Rust.\nHe called it \u0026ldquo;Heroes vs. Monsters\u0026rdquo;, and in CS 101 it was a simple text-based\nbattle. You could attack, you could heal, or you could do a special attack. The\nmonster would do the same. He made it more challenging in CS 201: now, there was\na dungeon, you had to fight your way to the end, and now you had a party of\nheroes fighting a group of monsters. Not a very complex game or project, but one\nI would enjoy recreating. I\u0026rsquo;ve even thought about giving a bit of a silly spin\nto make it something my kids could play.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWish me luck!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil next time,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCorbin\u003c/p\u003e\n","description":null,"image":null,"permalink":"https://cstaaben.github.io/blogs/and_so_it_begins/","title":"And so it begins..."}]
